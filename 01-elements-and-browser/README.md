📝 Lesson 01: Elements and Browser
In this lesson, I learned the basics of how browsers display web pages:

How to use Inspect Element to examine and temporarily modify page content.

The difference between Inspect Element and View Page Source.

How to view the HTML and CSS structure of a page using Developer Tools.

Why these tools are essential for learning and developing web pages.

This was my first step into understanding how websites really work behind the scenes!
