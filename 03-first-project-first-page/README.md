In this lesson, I learned several foundational skills:

How to create a new file inside the folder using VS Code.

🧱 My First HTML Element
I learned how to write my first HTML tag: <html>.

Inside the <html> element, there are two very important sections:

<head>: contains meta information about the page.

<body>: contains the actual content of the webpage.

🏷️ Title Tag
The <title> tag is placed inside the <head>.

It defines the name of the page that appears on the browser tab.

<html> 
  <head>
    <title>Book Store</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
