🧠 Lesson 4: The <head> Element & Meta Data
🔹 What is <head>?
The <head> section of an HTML document contains information about the page that is not directly visible to the user. It helps browsers and search engines understand the page better.

🧾 1. The <meta> Tag

<meta> is a self-closing tag.

It is used to store meta data — which means "data about data."

Meta tags don’t display content on the page, but are important for things like search engine optimization (SEO) and page behavior.

✴️ Common Meta Attributes:
🔤 Character Encoding

<meta charset="UTF-8">
The charset attribute defines the character encoding.

UTF-8 supports English, Arabic, and many other languages.

📝 Page Description

<meta name="description" content="This Is Our Book Store">
The name="description" meta tag provides a short description of the page.

This description does not appear on the webpage but shows in search engine results, under the page title.

🔍 Note: There are many types of meta tags. You don’t need to memorize them all — just search for what you need when you need it.

🎨 2. The <style> and <script> Tags
Both tags are placed inside the <head>.

They do not display content on the webpage.

✅ Uses:

<style> contains internal CSS rules for styling the page.

<script> contains or links to JavaScript code for interactivity.

🔗 3. The <link> Tag
This tag is used to link external resources like CSS files.

Example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

rel defines the relationship between the current document and the linked file (e.g., stylesheet).

href is the URL or path to the external file.
