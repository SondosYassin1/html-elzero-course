🧠 Lesson 5: Comments in HTML & When to Use Them
💬 What is a Comment?
A comment is a note or explanation added to the code that does not appear on the webpage. It is useful for:

Explaining why you wrote certain code (especially for teammates).

Reminding yourself later why something was done.

Temporarily hiding parts of the code from appearing or executing.

✍️ How to Write a Comment in HTML

<!-- This is a comment -->

The browser ignores anything inside <!-- -->.

Comments are not shown on the page.

🧑‍💻 Why Use Comments?
✅ Examples:

To explain a specific code decision:

<!-- We added this section to test responsive layout -->

To leave notes for your team:

html
نسخ
تحرير

<!-- This button will be replaced in the next update -->

To temporarily hide elements:

<!--
<section class="promo-banner">
  <h2>Big Sale!</h2>
</section>
-->

To remind your future self:

<!-- Don’t delete this part — used for fallback -->

🔹 Types of Comments
Type Example
Single-line comment <!-- Just one line -->
Multi-line comment

<!--
This is a multi-line comment.
Used when you want to explain something longer.
Or temporarily hide multiple lines of code.
-->

🧭 In the Future...
As you gain more experience, you’ll learn about documentation — a more organized and professional way to explain your code.
Good documentation can eventually replace most comments, especially in large projects.
