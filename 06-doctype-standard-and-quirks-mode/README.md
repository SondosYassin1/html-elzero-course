🧠 Lesson 6: What is <!DOCTYPE> in HTML?
❓ Is <!DOCTYPE> an HTML Tag?
No, <!DOCTYPE> is not an HTML element.
It is a declaration that tells the browser which version of HTML you are using.

🌐 Why Do We Use <!DOCTYPE>?
Modern webpages use:

<!DOCTYPE html>

This declares that the page is written using HTML5, which is the current standard.

Without this declaration, the browser may:

Switch to quirks mode, a compatibility mode that imitates old browser behavior.

Cause unexpected rendering issues or layout bugs.

So always start your HTML files with:

<!DOCTYPE html>

It’s short, simple, and very important.

🧪 What Happens If You Skip It?
If you forget to include <!DOCTYPE html>:

Browsers may not render your page correctly.

CSS or layout styles might behave strangely.

Your website might not be consistent across different browsers.
