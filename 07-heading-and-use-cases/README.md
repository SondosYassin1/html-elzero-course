07 - Headings and Use Cases
In HTML, headings have different levels from <h1> to <h6>, and each one has its own specific use.

By default, each heading element comes with built-in styles from the user agent stylesheet (the browser's default styles). Later on, you’ll be able to fully customize these styles using CSS.

<h1> is the main title of the page. It’s recommended to use only one <h1> per page to maintain SEO best practices and ensure a professional page structure.

<h2> is typically used for chapter titles or main sections.

<h3> is used for subsections inside a chapter.

If needed, you can continue using <h4>, <h5>, and <h6> for more detailed subdivisions.

It’s important to follow this hierarchical structure correctly. Skipping levels or using lower-level headings before higher-level ones is considered bad practice and may confuse both users and search engines.
