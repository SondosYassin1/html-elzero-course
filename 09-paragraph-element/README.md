09 - Paragraph Element
The <p> element is a block-level element in HTML.

By default, it creates space before and after itself.

These spaces come from the user agent stylesheet (the browserâ€™s default styling), which adds margins above and below the paragraph.

This behavior helps improve text readability and separates paragraphs visually without needing extra styling.
