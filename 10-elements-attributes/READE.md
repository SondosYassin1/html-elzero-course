Types of Attributes

1. Global Attributes
   These are attributes that can be used with any HTML element.

Some examples of global attributes:

class: Helps you identify and style elements using CSS

<div class="box"></div>
hidden: Makes an element invisible
<p hidden>This text will not appear on the page</p>
You can find the full list of global attributes by searching “HTML global attributes” on Google or by visiting MDN Web Docs.

2. Element-Specific Attributes
   These are attributes that only work with specific elements.

Examples:

<img> element:

src: Specifies the image source

alt: Provides alternative text
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scene">
<a> element:

href: Defines the link destination
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
