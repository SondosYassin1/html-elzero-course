11 - Text Formatting Without CSS
HTML provides several semantic tags that allow you to format text without using CSS. These tags help you style the content and also give it meaning, which improves accessibility and SEO.

🔤 Basic Formatting Tags
Tag Purpose Example
<b> Bold text (visual only) <b>Bold</b>
<strong> Important text (bold + semantic) <strong>Important</strong>
<i> Italic text (visual only) <i>Italic</i>
<em> Emphasized text (italic + semantic) <em>Emphasis</em>
<u> Underlined text <u>Underlined</u>
<mark> Highlighted text <mark>Highlighted</mark>
<small> Smaller text <small>Smaller text</small>

📝 Revision & Meaningful Changes
<del> – Used to indicate deleted/old content.
Especially helpful when updating content like prices or features, while still showing what was removed.

<p><del>$20</del> $15</p>
This helps search engines understand that you're updating existing content, not constantly replacing it — which is good for SEO!

<ins> – Used for inserted/new content.

<p><ins>New Feature Added</ins></p>
🔬 Scientific Notation
<sub> – Subscript (used in chemical formulas, etc.)

<sup> – Superscript (used in math, footnotes, etc.)

Examples:

<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>     <!-- Water -->
<p>2<sup>2</sup> = 4</p>  <!-- Math Power -->
These HTML tags allow you to style and structure your content meaningfully — no CSS required — while improving both user experience and search engine friendliness.
