✨ More Useful HTML Elements

🗨️ 1. <q> — Inline Quote
Used to insert a short inline quotation. Browsers usually render it with quotation marks automatically ("").

<p>The teacher said: <q>Practice makes perfect.</q></p>
✅ It's inline, meaning it appears inside the flow of the text.

Good for short quotes or phrases within a sentence.

🧾 2. <blockquote> — Block-Level Quote
Used for longer quotes or standalone quotations.

<blockquote>
    This is a wise saying that stands alone.
</blockquote>
✅ It's a block element, displayed with indentation.

Often used for citing large text from books, articles, or speeches.

🔘 3. <button> — Clickable Button
Creates a clickable button.
<button>Click Me</button>
Can be used to submit forms, run JavaScript, or trigger UI actions.

You can customize it with attributes like type="submit", type="button", and styling with CSS.

🔁 4. <wbr> — Word Break Opportunity
Suggests a place where the browser can break a long word if needed.

<p>SuperLongWordThatMay<wbr>BreakHere</p>
⚠️ Rarely used in modern CSS-based layouts.

CSS alternatives like word-wrap: break-word; are usually better and more flexible.

🌍 5. <bdi> — Bi-Directional Isolation
Stands for Bi-Directional Isolation.
Used to prevent direction conflicts between text with different writing directions (like Arabic and English).

<p><bdi>السلام</bdi> 2 welcome</p>
Without <bdi>, mixed direction texts may overlap or appear incorrectly.

Very useful when dynamically inserting user-generated content in multilingual environments.
